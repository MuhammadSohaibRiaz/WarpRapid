      <p>The web development landscape is constantly evolving, with new technologies and methodologies emerging at a rapid pace. As we look to the future, several key trends are poised to reshape how we build and interact with web applications.</p>
      
      <h2>1. WebAssembly (Wasm)</h2>
      <p>WebAssembly is revolutionizing web performance by allowing code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust to run in the browser at near-native speed. This opens up possibilities for bringing desktop-quality applications to the web, from video editing to complex games.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Edge Computing</h2>
      <p>Edge computing moves processing closer to the user, reducing latency and improving performance. Frameworks like Next.js are already embracing this approach with features like edge functions and middleware.</p>
      
      <h2>3. AI-Driven Development</h2>
      <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being integrated into development workflows, from code completion to automated testing. This trend will continue to grow, making developers more productive and helping to catch bugs earlier in the development process.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Headless Architecture</h2>
      <p>The separation of frontend and backend concerns continues to gain popularity, with headless CMS systems and API-first approaches becoming standard for many projects. This allows for greater flexibility and enables teams to work more independently.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Web3 and Decentralization</h2>
      <p>While still in its early stages, Web3 technologies like blockchain are beginning to influence how we think about ownership, identity, and data on the web. Decentralized applications (dApps) represent a fundamental shift in how web applications can be structured.</p>
      
      <p>As these technologies mature, web developers will need to adapt their skillsets and approaches. The most successful developers will be those who can balance staying current with new trends while maintaining a strong foundation in core web principles.</p>

    title: "Mastering React Hooks",

      <p>React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components since their introduction in React 16.8. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component.</p>
      
      <h2>Understanding useState</h2>
      <p>The useState hook is the most basic hook in React. It allows you to add state to functional components:</p>
      <pre><code>
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      </code></pre>
      
      <h2>Side Effects with useEffect</h2>
      <p>The useEffect hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes:</p>
      <pre><code>
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = \`You clicked \${count} times\`;
  
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code
  };
}, [count]); // Only re-run if count changes
      </code></pre>
      
      <h2>Context with useContext</h2>
      <p>The useContext hook makes it easier to consume React context without nesting:</p>
      <pre><code>
const value = useContext(MyContext);
      </code></pre>
      
      <h2>Performance Optimization with useMemo and useCallback</h2>
      <p>These hooks help you optimize performance by memoizing values and callbacks:</p>
      <pre><code>
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { doSomething(a, b); }, [a, b]);
      </code></pre>
      
      <h2>Custom Hooks</h2>
      <p>One of the most powerful features of hooks is the ability to create your own custom hooks, allowing you to extract component logic into reusable functions:</p>
      <pre><code>
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setSize({ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight });
    };
    
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    handleResize();
    
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);
  
  return size;
}
      </code></pre>
      
      <p>By mastering React Hooks, you can write more concise, readable, and maintainable React components. They encourage code reuse and separation of concerns, making your applications easier to reason about and test.</p>

      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming software development in profound ways, from automating routine tasks to enhancing developer productivity and improving code quality.</p>
      
      <h2>Code Generation and Completion</h2>
      <p>AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot and TabNine are changing how developers write code. These tools can suggest entire functions or blocks of code based on comments or context, significantly speeding up development time.</p>
      
      <h2>Automated Testing</h2>
      <p>AI is making testing more efficient by automatically generating test cases, identifying potential bugs, and even fixing simple issues without human intervention. This allows developers to focus on more complex problems while ensuring code quality.</p>
      
      <h2>Intelligent Code Review</h2>
      <p>AI systems can analyze code for potential issues, suggest improvements, and ensure adherence to best practices. This leads to higher quality code and helps junior developers learn from AI-suggested improvements.</p>
      
      <h2>Predictive Analytics</h2>
      <p>By analyzing historical project data, AI can predict potential bottlenecks, estimate completion times more accurately, and help teams allocate resources more effectively.</p>
      
      <h2>Natural Language Processing for Requirements</h2>
      <p>AI can help translate natural language requirements into technical specifications or even directly into code, bridging the gap between business stakeholders and development teams.</p>
      
      <h2>The Future: AI Pair Programming</h2>
      <p>As AI systems become more sophisticated, we're moving toward a future where AI acts as a pair programming partner, offering suggestions, catching errors in real-time, and even participating in architectural decisions.</p>
      
      <p>While AI won't replace human developers, it is becoming an indispensable tool that amplifies human capabilities. Developers who learn to effectively collaborate with AI tools will have a significant advantage in the evolving landscape of software development.</p>
